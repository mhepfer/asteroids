<h4>Why&#39s this game weird?</h4>

<p>In this rendition of Asteroids, there is a low speed of light. Therefore, you can easily see the effects of special relativity.</p>

<h4>Why&#39s my ship shrinking?</h4>

<p>As an object travels closer to the speed of light, it experiences length contraction in the direction of its velocity.</p>

<h4>What&#39s a frame?</h4>

<p>This game allows you to play in two distinct frames. The first is the global frame. This is you as the outside observer. The second is the ships frame. This is what you would see if you were standing on the ship. As the outside observer in the global frame, you see everything contracting. If you&#39re on the ship, you would experience the rest of the world as if you were stationary, therefore, you see the asteroids and bullets moving around you and contracting accordingly. </p>

<h4>Why aren&#39t my bullets firing right away?</h4>

<p>The ship experiences time dilation. Time is weird. As the ship&#39s velocity approaches the speed of light, the clock on the ship ticks normally. However, the stationary clock outside the ship appears to tick slower. To make time stranger, the outside stationary observer sees his clock tick normally, and the clock on the ship tick slower. Therefore, from the global frame, the bullets appear to be firing from the ship more slowly. On the ship, they seem to be firing at the same speed.</p>

<h4>COMING SOON The asteroids collisions are crazy</h4>

<p>As an object travels closer to the speed of light, it becomes more massive. </p>
